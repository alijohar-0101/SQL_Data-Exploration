# SQL_Data-Exploration
Exploring the Covid_19 dataset as my first full fledged data analysis project. I have explored the raw data using SQL, then presented the reports in MS Excel and finally I visualized the data using Tableau. The visualization file is included here and also available to see in Tableau Public. 

As this is my first data analysis project, any kind of feedback or constructive criticism is very much appreaciated.
